=====================
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/MapSlicer

MapSlicer is a graphical application for online map publishing. Your map can create overlay of standard maps like OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, Yahoo Maps or Bing Maps and can be also visualized in 3D by Google Earth. The only thing you have to do for publishing the map is to upload the automatically generated directory with tiles into your webserver.

MapSlicer is an open-source application, distributed under the New BSD License.
It can run on several platforms, including Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X.

You can download the source code from the repository at https://github.com/kalxas/mapslicer
